**Dockerfiles for Various Programming Languages and Frameworks**

This repository provides Dockerfiles for building production-ready images for various programming languages and frameworks. The goal is to:

* **Improve performance**: By using multi-stage builds and Alpine Linux base images, the resulting images are significantly smaller and faster than traditional Docker images.
* **Simplify deployment**: Dockerfiles provide a consistent and repeatable way to build and deploy your applications.
* **Encourage collaboration**: By sharing Dockerfiles in a public repository, developers can learn from each other and contribute to the development of better Docker images.

## Performance Comparison

The following table compares the size of a Next.js application built with a traditional Dockerfile and the Dockerfile in this repository:

| Build Method | Size |
|---|---|
| Traditional Dockerfile | 1.2 GB |
| Dockerfile in this repository | ~150 MB |

As you can see, the Dockerfile in this repository reduces the size of the Next.js application by **87%**.

## Available Dockerfiles

The following Dockerfiles are currently available in this repository:

* [**Astro**](./astro/README.md)
* [**Go**](./go/README.md)
* [**Next.js**](./next/README.md)
